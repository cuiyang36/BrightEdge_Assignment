There are two folders in this assignment folder, they are source_code folder and documentation folder. The running environment is Python 2.7.

I will specify the locations of expected deliverables for you:

(1) Executable file: because I use python, so you can directly use terminal to cd into source_code folder then run the Scraper_main.py script, like:

python Scraper_main.py “digital camera”

or 

python Scraper_main.py “digital camera” 2

(2) Source code: all the source code is in the source_code folder

(3) Documentation: It’s a htm file called “Documentation_Yang_Wang.htm”, you can directly open it.


By the way, please read the documentation “Documentation_Yang_Wang.htm” first before you execute the script, because I have written the preparation and execution methods in that htm file in details.

Thanks for watching this!
